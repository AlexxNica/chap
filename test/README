This directory is used for files used to test chap, including scripts, some
sample input files (cores and such) and expected outputs, as well as source
for some generator programs that can be used to create new cores.

The most important testing done here is running commands from chap against
existing cores to verify that the output is as expected, by verifying against
previous runs.  If the output does not match, one must check why.  If the old
output was simply less correct it can be replaced.  If the new output is wrong
that indicates a regression that should be fixed.  Those tests can be found
under expectedOutputTests.

For generating cores to use as input, generally not needed unless one supports
a new combination of file format, memory allocator and byte alignment, various
source files are available under generators.  It is is desirable to add new 
generators to extend the testing or add regression tests for recent bugs.
